# Introduction to Deep Learning Building Neural Networks Using Deeplearning4j

This class is an essential course for Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers looking to use Neural Networks in Production. Deep Learning: Building Neural Networks Using Deeplearning4J provides participants with the information they need to determine which type of Neural Network is best suited for the task and how to configure, train, evaluate and deploy the Neural Network using Java.

# Course Duration 

3 days and includes hands on Labs as well as Lecture.


# Who Should Attend?
This class is suited for Data Scientist and Data Analysts wishing to take advantage of recent breakthroughs in the field of Deep Learning.

# Course Prerequisites

Attendees with some programming experience will benefit the most from this course. The labs and Neural Networks will be built using Java using DeepLearning4J and IntelliJ but Python coders and SQL users are welcome.
