# Natural Language Processing using Neural Networks

Neural Networks have achieved great success processing written language and speech. In this class you will learn how to use a Neural Network and associated tools to analyze text input or generate text output. 
 

# Who Should Attend?

This class is suited for Data Scientist and Data Analysts wishing to take advantage of recent breakthroughs in the field of Deep Learning.

# Course Prerequisites

Attendees with some programming experience will benefit the most from this course. The labs and Neural Networks will be built using Java using DeepLearning4J and IntelliJ but Python coders and SQL users are welcome. 

# Class Agenda

This two-day hands-on class will cover the topics listed below.

* Neural Network Basics
