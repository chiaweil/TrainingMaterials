# Production Examples

This section will provide some examples on moving a model from training to inference and deploying that model. 

!SLIDE

# MNist image pipeline

Provides step by step code development from ingestion to inference

!SLIDE 

# VGG16 provides example from Keras Model Import to Production

!SLIDE

# The Instructor will walk through some code
