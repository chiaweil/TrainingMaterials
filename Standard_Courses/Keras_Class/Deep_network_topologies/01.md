# Main Topologies of Neural Networks

!SLIDE

# Common Neural Network Architectures

* MLP(Multi Layer Perceptron) or FeedForward Neural Network
* Recurrent Neural Network
* Convolutional Neural Network

!SLIDE

# Multi Layer Perceptron

* Good for General Use
* single input maps to single output
* Number of classes = Number of output Nodes


!SLIDE

# Recurrent Neural Networks

* LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)
* Goodwith Sequence Data
* Ability to Learn time dependencies that effect output
* One to many, many to one 


!SLIDE

# Convolutional Neural Networks

* Convolutional Layers
* 3 dimensional input
* Learned filters Convolve over image
