# Deep Learning Paths to Production with Keras and DL4J

This class is an essential course for Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers looking to use Neural Networks in Production. Deep Learning Paths to Production with Keras and DL4j provides participants with the skills and tools needed to take a Deep Learning model from Prototype to successful Production Deployment.

This class is the best preparation to meet the real-world challenges with a combination of Python and Java. Course duration is two days and includes hands-on practical Labs. It will cover utilization of popular Deep Learning Frameworks and tools, such as Keras, Tensorflow, DeepLearning4j (DL4J,) along with supporting tools like Apache Spark.
 
# What you will learn

In this class you will learn how to:
* Develop, Train, and Serve a model utilizing Keras and DL4J
* Select and Configure the appropriate Keras Backend
* Serialize a trained Python model to storage and load that model into DL4J
* Apply Transfer Learning per a Pretrained model, Fine-Tuning the Network for the target use case
* Parallelize a network using Distributed Hardware (CPUs and GPUs)
