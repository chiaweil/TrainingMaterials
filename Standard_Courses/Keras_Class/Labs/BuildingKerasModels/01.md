# Note

Copying and pasting from a pdf can sometimes introduce non-printing characters, typically for indents or newlines. You should be aware of this if your code looks correct but fails. The solution is to delete the white space and replace the white space manually. 


# A Keras Model

In this Lab you will build a Keras Model to analyze the iris flower dataset for classification of Iris' based on the measurements of petals and sepals

The file you are going to us

* resources/Keras/iris.csv


The Data looks like this. 

```
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.6,3.1,1.5,0.2,Iris-setosa
5.0,3.6,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
5.4,3.9,1.7,0.4,Iris-setosa
4.6,3.4,1.4,0.3,Iris-setosa
```

# Step One


## Action:
Create a text file called iris.py in your favorite text editor. 

Add the following imports to the file





```
import numpy
import pandas
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasClassifier
from keras.utils import np_utils
from sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_score, KFold
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
```


# Step 2

##Background: 

The intitial weights of the Neural Network are set Randomly. In order to have reproducable results you can set a Random Seed manually. This way multiple runs will be consistent


## Action: 

Add the following lines to your iris.py file

```
# fix random seed for reproducibility
seed = 7
numpy.random.seed(seed)
```


# Step 3

## Background: 
To load the date we rely on pandas dataframe. The common pattern is to specify the Parameters as X and the Labels as Y. The data is in a CSV file. Use the padas.read_csv method to load the data.

The Print statements are there so you can visualize the data

## Action: 

Add the following lines to your iris.py file.


```
# load dataset
dataframe = pandas.read_csv("iris.csv", header=None)
dataset = dataframe.values
X = dataset[:,0:4].astype(float)
Y = dataset[:,4]
print(X)
print(Y)
```

# Step 4: Convert text Labels to numeric 

## Background: 
Neural Nets ingest multi dimensional arrays of numeric values, all input has to be converted to numeric. 


## Action:
Add the following code to your iris.py file. 

```
#encode class values as integers
encoder = LabelEncoder()
encoder.fit(Y)
encoded_Y = encoder.transform(Y)
```


# Step 5 convert integer class labels to one_hot, or dummy encoding. 

## Background: 
The three classes are currently encoded 0,1,2. We need to encode them as. 

```
1,0,0
0,1,0
0,0,1
```

## Action: Add the following lines to your iris.py file

```
# convert integers to dummy variables (hot encoded)
dummy_y = np_utils.to_categorical(encoded_Y)
print(dummy_y)
```

# Step 6 Create a model


## Action

Add the following lines to your iris.py file


```
# define baseline model
#def baseline_model():
# create model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(4, input_dim=4, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(3,activation='sigmoid'))
```


# Step 7 Compile the model

## Background: 

Step 6 just defines the model to use the model it must be compiled.

## Action:

Add the following lines to your iris.py file.

```
# Compile model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

# Step 8 Train the model and get prediction

## Background:

The model is ready to train, Calling the fit method on the model class trains the model. When training you specify the NDarray for the data, the NDarray for the labels, the number of epochs(total passes through the data) and the batchsize(home many records between weight updates. 

## Action: 

Add the following lines to your iris.py file


```
# Train model and get prediction
#model.fit
model.fit(X, dummy_y, nb_epoch=200, batch_size=5)
prediction = model.predict(numpy.array([[4.6,3.6,1.0,0.2]]));
print(prediction);
```

# Step 9 Save the model 

## Background: 

To move the model to production in Java you need to save some combination of the configuration the weights or both. 

## Action: 

Add the following lines to your iris.py


```
# To save just the weights
model.save_weights('/tmp/iris_model_weights')

# To save the weights and the config
# Note this is what is used for this demo
model.save('/tmp/full_iris_model')

# To save the Json config to a file
json_string = model.to_json()
text_file = open("/tmp/iris_model_json", "w")
text_file.write(json_string)
text_file.close()

```
