# Lab Prep

1. Step One


```
git clone https://github.com/tomthetrainer/KerasWorkshop.git
```

2. Step two

Import the project into Intellij by following instructions at https://deeplearning4j.org/quickstart

3. Additional Resources

Two saved Keras Model for VGG-16 and the DL4J version are too large to put into the main github repo. I have included them on github by creating a release for the project. 

Although there is no specific Lab to load those models, there are examples in the Solution project that show loading these large useful models for image recognition. 


Get the saved models from the following url

https://github.com/tomthetrainer/KerasWorkshop/releases

vgg16.zip

vgg_combined_save.h5

The Labs expect those to be in the /tmp directory. Either place them there or modify the java code that refers to the file path. 


4. Structure of the Lab Repo.

Navigate to src/main/java/ai.skymind.training and you will find 3 projects

* demos
* labs
* solutions


## labs

You will work through the Lab detailed later in this document in the labs project. A stub file is prepared for you and the instructions will walk you through completing the code. 

## demos

Some demos are available in the demo project. These are complete code examples. 

1. ImageDemo demonstrates simple image into INDArray using NativeImageLoder
2. IrisNoImport is a working example of classification of iris flower data
3. Simplest network is a very simple network that takes a single value input and trains towards a single value output. It also shows the Web based User Interface. 
4. VGG16SparkJavaWebApp, takes network that was imported from Keras into DL4J and builds web app to run inference onuser selected image. 

## solutions

Working solutions to the labs and a few other included examples.
