# Lab Prep

1. Step One


```
git clone https://github.com/tomthetrainer/KerasWorkshop.git
```

2. Step two

Import the project into Intellij by following instructions at https://deeplearning4j.org/quickstart

3. Additional Resources

Two saved Keras Model for VGG-16 and the DL4J version are too large to put into the main github repo. I have included them on github by creating a release for the project. 

Although there is no specific Lab to load those models, there are examples in the Solution project that show loading these large useful models for image recognition. 


Get the saved models from the following url

https://github.com/tomthetrainer/KerasWorkshop/releases

vgg16.zip

vgg_combined_save.h5

The Labs expect those to be in the /tmp directory. Either place them there or modify the java code that refers to the file path.
