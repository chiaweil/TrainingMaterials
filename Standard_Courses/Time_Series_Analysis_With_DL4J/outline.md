# Neural Networks for Time Series Analysis Using Deeplearning4j

Recurrent neural networks have proven to be very effective at analyzing time series or sequential data, so how can you apply these benefits to your use case? Attend this class and learn how to use Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTMâ€™s) to classify and generate sequences. 
 

# Who Should Attend?

This class is suited for Data Scientist and Data Analysts wishing to take advantage of recent breakthroughs in the field of Deep Learning.Knowledge of a programming language is preferable. Labs are performed in Java. 
 
# Course Prerequisites

Attendees with some programming experience will benefit the most from this course. The labs and Neural Networks will be built using Java using DeepLearning4J and IntelliJ but Python coders and SQL users are welcome.
