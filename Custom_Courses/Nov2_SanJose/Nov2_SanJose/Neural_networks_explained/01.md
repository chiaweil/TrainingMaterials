# Connections Between Nodes



* Designed to be selective and trainable
* Filter, aggregate, convert, amplify, ignore what they pass on to next neuron
* This transformation converts raw input into useful information
* Input has trainable weight applied
* Output determined by activation function

# Single Node Diagram Discussion

* Input
  * Input is determined by the output of the input neurons * the weights applied to that output

* Weights
  * Assigned randomly* initially between 0-1
  * Weight of 0, input is ignored
  * Large weight input is amplified 
  * As the network trains weights are adjusted

* Output
	* Output is determined but it's input * weights, and the activation function. 
	* Sigmoid activation low input output 0 higher input output 1, in between S curve.
 	* ReLU low input 0 then linear after trigger.

# Key Terms Review

* Activation Function
  * A nonlinear A function that maps input on a nonlinear scale such as sigmoid or tanh. By definition, a nonlinear function’s output is not directly proportional to its input
* Loss Function
  * How error is calculated
* Weights
* BackProp

# Training a Neural Net

* Inputs: Data you want to produce information from
* Connection weights and biases govern the activity of the network
* Learning algorithm changes weights and biases with each learning pass

# Evaluation and The Confusion Matrix

* Table representing
	* Predictions vs Actual Data
* We count these answers to get
	* True Positives
	*  False Positives
	* True Negatives
	* False Negatives
* Allows us to evaluate the model beyond “average accurate” percent
	* Can look at well a model can perform when it needs to be more than just “accurate a lot”
