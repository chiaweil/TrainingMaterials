!SLIDE

# FeedForward Neural Network

## Also called Multi-Layer Perceptron

* Fully Connected, or Dense Layers
* Forward Connections only

!SLIDE


# FeedForward Neural Network Uses

* Supervised Learning
* Classification
* Regression

!SLIDE

# FeedForward Neural Network Data

* Tabular data
* Image data

!SLIDE

# FeedForward Neural Network Output 

* Flexible
  * Range of values, one of a class probabilities
* Limitation 
  * one input maps to one output



!SLIDE

# Recurrent Neural Networks

## RNN / LSTM

* In this class when we talk about RNNs we are typically talking about LSTMs

!SLIDE

# Recurrent Neural Networks Uses


* Sequence or Time Series Data



!SLIDE

# Recurrent Neural Networks Flexibility

## Flexible Mapping of Input to Output

* One to Many
  * Image to words for caption
* Many to Many
  * French word sequence to English word sequence
* Many to one
  * Speaker identification given voice sample
  
  
!SLIDE

# Convolutional Neural Network

* Inspired by the visual cortex
* Useful for image recognition



!SLIDE

# How Convolutional Neural Networks differ from other Networks

* Image data analyzed as 4D NDArrays (tensors)
* For a 10*10 image, a series of 3*3, or 5*5 subsets are analyzed

<!-- * Need more on Convnets -->

# Other Useful Neural Network Types

**Not covered in this course**

* Variational Autoencoders
* Restricted Boltzman Machines
* more....

!SLIDE

# Variational Autoencoders

* Unsupervised learning of features
* Input -> Neural Net -> rebuild input
* Reduction in dataset dimensionality


!SLIDE

# Restricted Boltzmann Machines

* Feature extraction and dimensionality reduction
* Model probability
* Useful for the pre-training phase in other large Deep Networks
