# Using an LSTM to predict patient mortality using ICU data

!SLIDE

# Physionet Challenge 2012

* Predict patient mortality Using Intensive Care Unit(ICU) data

!SLIDE

# Data Used

* Patient Data collected over first 2 days of ICU stay
* 12,000 patients
* Reasons for admission
  * Cardiac
  * Medical
  * Surgical
  * Trauma
  
!SLIDE

# Data Structure

* Up to 42 variables recorded
* Observations inlcude time-stamp 
  * Format number of seconds since admission
* Stored in CSV files

!SLIDE

# General Descriptors

* Recorded once
  * RecordID (a unique integer for each ICU stay)
  * Age (years)
  * Gender (0: female, or 1: male)
  * Height (cm)
  * ICUType (1: Coronary Care Unit, 2: Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit,3: Medical ICU, or 4: Surgical ICU)
  * Weight (kg)
  
!SLIDE

# Time Series

* Recorded at one or more intervals during stay
* Measurements such as
  * Blood Pressure
  * Blood PH
  * Body Temperature
  * Many more see https://physionet.org/challenge/2012/ for details


!SLIDE 

# Outcome Related Descriptors or Labels

* Length of Stay
* Survival
  * 0 survived in hospital stay
  * 1 Died in hospital
  
!SLIDE

# Data Structure

* Collection of Files in Resources folder

!SLIDE

# Mortality

* 4,000 files
* FileName== PatientID
* Single line
  * 0 Survived
  * 1 Died

# Prepared Data Format Explained

* 1 File per patient
* 1 line per time step
* Additional Flag for recorded vs missing values

!SLIDE

# Reading the Training Data Into DataVec

* Contained in Directory physionet2012/sequence

<pre>
 SequenceRecordReader trainFeatures = new CSVSequenceRecordReader(1, ",");
</pre>

!SLIDE

# CSVSequenceReader

* Read sequences of data in CSV format, where
* Each sequence is defined in its own file (and there are multiple files)
* Each line in the file represents one time step

!SLIDE

# NumberedFileInputSplit

* Used for Files where the FileNumber contains the index
* Features in one directory of Numbered Files, Labels in other directory of Numbered files

!SLIDE

# NumberedFileInputSplit Example

* Directory Containing "myFile_100.txt", "myFile_101.txt", ..., "myFile_200.txt" 
  * NumberedFileInputSplit("myFile_%d.txt",100,200) 
  * Uses String.format(), to extract index
  * "%d" to represent the integer index
  
!SLIDE

# Loading the Labels

* Label is in format
  * x.csv where x is patient ID
  * One line with Value 0 or 1

!SLIDE

# Load Labels Continued...

<pre>
SequenceRecordReader trainLabels = new CSVSequenceRecordReader();
trainLabels.initialize(new NumberedFileInputSplit(labelsDir.getAbsolutePath() 
+ "/%d.csv", 0, NB_TRAIN_EXAMPLES - 1));
</pre>

!SLIDE

# Combining the Labels and Features into a DataSet


```
trainData = new SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator(trainFeatures, trainLabels,
                    
BATCH_SIZE, numLabelClasses, false, SequenceRecordReaderDataSetIterator.AlignmentMode.ALIGN_END);
```

!SLIDE

# Test and Validation Data

* Use same classes as above


!SLIDE

# Use Transform Process

* DataVec Transform Process is used to re-organize data
* Cast Categorical to Int
* Join DataSets
* Remove or Combine Columns
* Useful if you want to try different manipulations of the data for testing

!SLIDE

# DataVec Transform Process

* Describe Original Schema
* Describe Transform Process 
* Execute Transform
* Uses Spark 


!SLIDE 

# Building A Neural Network to Process the Data

* Single LSTM Layer 200 Neurons
* CSVSequenceRecordReader 
* NumberedFileInputSplit
* Labels and features loaded separately
  * Merged with DataSetIterator
* Use ROC curve to calculate accuracy
